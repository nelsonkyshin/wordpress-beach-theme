# Wordpress Beach Theme

Developed as a fun exercise in playing with CSS transitions and animations and some free assets found on OpenGameArt.org and loosely learning Wordpress theme development

## Steps
* Edit `webpack.config.js` to copy the `dist` folder into your desired Wordpress installation's theme folder, or comment it out if you don't need to copy anything
* Run `npm run dev` from the project root folder. Files will be watched
